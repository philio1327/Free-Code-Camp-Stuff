            What is the map method and how does it work?
            The map method is a powerful and widely used function in JavaScript that operates on arrays. It is designed
            to create a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original array. This method does
            not modify the original array but instead returns a new array containing the results of the function applied
            to each element. Here's an example of using the map method on an array of numbers. To create a new array
            where each number is doubled we are using the map method. The map method accepts a callback function where
            the function is called on every single element on the array. In this case each number in the array will be
            multiplied by two. The result will be a new array of the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. The callback function can
            accept up to 3 arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second argument is
            the index of the current element being processed. The third argument is the array where map is being called
            on. Understanding and effectively using the map method can significantly improve your ability to work with
            arrays in JavaScript. In future lecture videos, we'll dive deeper into more advanced uses of map and explore
            how it can be a powerful tool for building dynamic and efficient programs.
