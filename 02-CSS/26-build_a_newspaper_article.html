        <h3 class="sub-headline">Startups, innovation hubs, and digital breakthroughs are putting Canada’s capital on
            the global tech map.</h3>
        <h4 class="author">By Joseph Smith</h4>
        <p class="text">Ottawa may be Canada’s capital, but it’s also quietly becoming a heavyweight in the tech world.
            With a thriving ecosystem of startups, research hubs, and established giants, the city is transforming from
            government town to innovation powerhouse. From Kanata’s tech park to the downtown core, the digital energy
            is impossible to miss.</p>
        <p class="text">What sets Ottawa apart is its unique mix of talent, infrastructure, and collaboration. Homegrown
            companies are making global waves in AI, cybersecurity, and communications tech — and they’re doing it with
            the support of a close-knit, forward-thinking community. The future of Canadian tech is already here — and
            it’s wearing a tuque.</p>
