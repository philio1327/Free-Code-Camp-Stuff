        <p id="tribute-info">Sir Henri Charles Wilfrid Laurier[a] (November 20, 1841 â€“ February 17, 1919) was a Canadian
            lawyer, statesman, and Liberal politician who served as the seventh prime minister of Canada from 1896 to
            1911. The first French Canadian prime minister, his 15-year tenure remains the longest uninterrupted term of
            office among Canadian prime ministers and his nearly 45 years of service in the House of Commons is a record
            for the House. Laurier is best known for his compromises between English and French Canada.</p>
